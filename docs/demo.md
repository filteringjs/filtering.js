# [Demo]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}})

> Note: As shown in the [performance section here]({{site.baseurl}}/#performance), the performance for even a huge number of items is
> incredible. However, the demo uses simple CSS transition to show and hide filtered items, causing the container and items to reflow
> multiple times. This is not recommended for a large dataset but still looks good enough for demonstration purposes.
